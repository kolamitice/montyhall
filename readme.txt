----Montyhall Problem----
There are 3 doors. Behind two of them is a goat and behind the remaining door is money.
The player chooses a door. Monty then reveales a door, where a goat waits behind. 
Monty gives you the option to swap your chosen door with the other closed door or to stay with your door.
Monty then reveals where the money is. If the money is behind your door you win.
